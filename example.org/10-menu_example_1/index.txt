#menu=$title
</filewiki_vars>

Within this Directory, the index of the files are not in the filename
(like xx-myfile.txt), but rather explicitely set in by the variable
`INDEX` in `filewiki_vars`.

Note that no `menu` variable is set in `filewiki_vars`. This way the
page does not get a separate entry in the menu (compared to
Menu-Example-2, where it does).
