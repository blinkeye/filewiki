This is the index page of `20-menu-example`.

Within this Directory, the index of the files are implicitely set by the filename
(xx-myfile.txt).

Note that the `menu` variable is set in `filewiki_vars`. This way the
page does get a separate entry in the menu (compared to
Menu-Example-1, where it does not).
