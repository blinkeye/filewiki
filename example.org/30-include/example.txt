FileWiki Editor
===============

This is an demonstration of the FileWiki Web Frontend.  It is intended
to give you an idea on how pages can be managed using FileWiki.

Use the "Edit", "CMS", "Vars", "Map" and debug buttons above to
navigate.

**Editing is not functional on this page!**

Purists don't use this. They check out the web page sources from the
repository, edit the source files with a text editor, and install the
site using the FileWiki command line client.
