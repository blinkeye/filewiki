Installation
============

FileWiki comes with a command-line based interface, as well as a
(rather experimental) web interface.


Prerequisites
-------------

As all Perl programs, FileWiki depends on some standard modules, which
are available on CPAN. The Makefile will complain about missing modules.

Depending on what plugins you enable, you will need:

- Text::Markdown (needed for the example sites)
- Text::Textile
- Pod::Simple::HTML
- Image::ExifTool
- ...


Instructions
------------

First, [download] the newest FileWiki release.
Unzip the tarball, go to the filewiki directory and type:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make install

This will install the `filewiki` executable along with the FileWiki
Perl modules to your system. The Makefile will warn you about missing
Perl modules.

That's it! Now you can build FileWiki sites:

    filewiki examples/helloworld.org

This will build the `helloworld.org` example site to the target directory
`/tmp/filewiki/htdocs`.

Have a look at the more complex `example.org` site, this is intended to
give you an idea on how FileWiki works.

###Apache Handler

An example on how to configure FileWiki as a HTTP PerlResponseHandler
is provided in the `Apache::FileWiki::Handler` perl module
documentation. Refer to the [Apache HTTP Handlers] documentation for
detailed information.

Note that this is rather experimental, and *very insecure*, so make
sure you don't install this on a publicly available location!
