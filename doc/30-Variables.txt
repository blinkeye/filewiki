Variables
=========

Flexible variable declaration and propagation is the heart of the
FileWiki system.  While some variables affect the FileWiki system,
they are basically used as input to the template processor. Every page
merges its `vars` from various locations (see
[Propagation](#propagation) below).


Declaration
-----------

Variables are declared in a simple "key=value" or "key value"
format. Already defined variables (and some [system variables]) can
be reused in the declaration by the '$' (dollar) sign.

- Lines starting with '#' (hash) are ignored
- Trailing whitespaces are cut off
- Values can be quoted

  [system variables]: system_variables.html

Example:

    title=Summary
    menu=$title

This results in both "title" and "menu" variables to have the value
"Summary". This is equivalent to:

    title  "Summary"
    menu   $title




Propagation
-----------

#### tree vars

Parsed from file "tree.vars" in every directory.

`tree.vars` are propagated to `dir.vars` and `page.vars`, and are
persistent within sub-directories. In sub-directories, they supersede
the `tree.vars` of the parent directory.


#### dir vars

Parsed from file "dir.vars" in every directory.

Used for the directory node. Consider the `dir.vars` as metadata for the
directory they are located in.  `dir.vars` are not propagated, but are
accessible on a page via the `DIR` variable.


#### page vars

Parsed from file "&lt;source_file&gt;.vars".

`page.vars` supersede the `tree.vars` for a page.  Consider the
`page.vars` as metadata for a page. Every source page can have
`page.vars`.


#### nested vars

Parsed from within source files.

Nested vars supersede the `page.vars`. FileWiki starts to parse nested
variables from the source file after it first encounters a line
starting with `<filewiki_vars>` or `[filewiki_vars]`, up to
`</filewiki_vars>` or `[/filewiki_vars]`.

Note that the `nested.vars` are stripped off the source file when
processing the input filters.

Example:

    Page text...

    <filewiki_vars>
    key=value
    ...
    </filewiki_vars>

    Page text...


As a special feature for pages which are also parsed outside FileWiki
(e.g. perl modules), a "comment" character is defined by the first
character preceding <code>&lt;filewiki_vars&gt;</code>.

Example (equivalent to example above):

    File text (e.g. Perl code)...
    #<filewiki_vars>
    #key=value
    #...
    #</filewiki_vars>
    File text...

In this example, the "comment" character is set to '#', and all
variables are parsed.
