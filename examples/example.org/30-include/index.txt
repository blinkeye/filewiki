</filewiki_vars>

This section includes the FileWiki documentation folder, by setting
"INCLUDE=$BASEDIR/../../doc[doc]" in the dir.vars.

Note the files "doc.dir.vars" and "doc.tree.vars": these define the
vars of the included directory marked as "[doc]".

"doc.tree.vars" sets the "subdoc_root" variable, which is evaluated in
"template/content_header.tt" and generates the documentation menu on
top of the page.
