Welcome to FileWiki
===================
 
This site is intended to give you an overview over the capabilites of
FileWiki.

In order to correctly build this site for local browsing, type the
following command in your shell:

    filewiki `pwd`/example.org

The `pwd` command makes sure that the `BASEDIR` variable becomes an
absolute path, so that the links are build correctly.

Note that you need to comment out the `URI_PREFIX` variable in
`example.org/tree.vars` when using the FileWiki Apache Handler (or set it
to a valid prefix, likes "/filewiki_test/").


----------

Try the FileWiki buttons on top of the site (they have been activated
by the "filewiki_controls" variable). Note that the full functionality
is only available when running the FileWiki Apache Handler.

- **Edit**: Here you can see the source file of the current page.

- **CMS**: This executes a user-defined command (`CMD_*` variables in
  `example.org/tree.vars`).

- **Vars**: Shows the vars propagated to the current page.

- **Map**: Shows the site map.

- **E W I D T**: Show different logger levels.
